        <h4>Kevin Shu CS347 Section 1</h4>
        <p>
            1. My client is my friend who is an undergraduate at CU Boulder. <br>
            2. My content is original, and the only images I used was from <a
                href="https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/">here</a> and <a
                href="http://clipart-library.com/clip-art/calculator-transparent-8.htm">here</a>. Both state to be free
            for personal use<br>
            3. My content has atleast 5 separate pages:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>https://project1.shuki.me/index.html</li>
            <li>https://project1.shuki.me/contact.html</li>
            <li>https://project1.shuki.me/list.html</li>
            <li>https://project1.shuki.me/henderson-hasselbalch.html</li>
            <li>https://project1.shuki.me/blosum-62-substitution-matrix.html</li>
            <li>https://project1.shuki.me/binomial-formula.html</li>
            <li>https://project1.shuki.me/chance-calculator.html</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            4. My page's header is the black bar at the top of each page/each page's title(Welcome!, Contact Us, etc...)<br>
            5. My navigation links exist in my header/list.html/sidebar.<br>
            6. My website supports media-queries for mobile devices at a px width of 768. <br><br>
            7. My website maintains coherent style through the use of a coherent background color and navbar/sidebar.
            Repeated styling can be found in css/main.css<br>
            8. My site contains the image of a calculator on the index.html page, with the alt attribute ="picture of a
            calculator". This is the only image on my website.<br>
            9. Each page has a <a href="https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/">favicon</a>.<br><br>
            10. My css/js files are placed in folders: css, js and my images are in a folder named images<br>
            11. My site uses the MathJax library. I chose to still include it because I am unable to reimplement these
            ideas for screen readers.
            During the construction of my website, you commented about MathJax briefly during one of the peer-review
            sessions and at the time
            I thought it was safe to use. My plea for still getting credit on this portion is based on the fact that if
            I didn't use MathJax,
            I would simply replace the equations with stylized fonts/images. I would consider doing so fairly simple and
            thus not indicative of a learning impedement.
            Additionally, I imagine this requirement was set in place so that people don't build every button,
            container, etc with external libraries. I don't consider
            MathJax to necessarily fall within those categories.<br>
            12. Each page is validated the W3C's Nu Validator.<br><br>
            13. My content is aligned left with the header/equation aligned at the top center of the page for both
            mobile and desktop view.<br>
            14. My website headers have a font of: "Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;" and the rest of the content is a
            generic "sans-serif".<br>
            15. Each of my calculators have a form input that invoke client-side calculations for it's given calculator.
            <br><br>
            16. My sites 'index page' list.html, contains links to wikipedia articles further explaining the content of
            each calculator <br>
            17. I would consider my source code to be readable, and that my naming conventions purposefully describes
            the content.<br>
            18. My website's side-bar (opened by clicking the icon on the top left), has a javascript animation with its
            width.<br><br>
            19. My site is on a git repository and is shared with twodee.<br>
            20. All of my file names are lower case.<br>
            21. My site does have a domain name (shuki.me)<br><br>
            22. My site is on HTTPS on port 443.<br>
            23. Users are redirected to port 443 when using port 80.<br>
            24. My git log, at the time of writing this has over 20 commits. (Dates: 9/23, 9/24, 10/1, 10/7, 10/13,
            10/14).<br>

            Critique: The website does it's job. It's nice to have <a
                href="https://project1.shuki.me/blosum-62-substitution-matrix.html">this</a> calcualtor since manually
            doing it is annoying and I couldn't find any other website that does this.
